# Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-Class)
> [!NOTE]
> Full disclaimer: I very much followed the instructions from ProfessorBoots' YouTube; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqv2w0qYf-s](url). I may add my own functionality and update this one day, but as of the present moment, I am about 2 minutes into the YouTube videos.

## Step 1: 3D Print all Wall-E's body

3D Files can be found on [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5957438](url) or in the repository's "3D Print Files" Folder. 
All parts will be in PLA except for the tracks, which should be in TPU to make them nice and flexible.
Obviously, instead of making the main body of WALL-E yellow, I made mine pink for fun. Your choice I guess.

## Step 2: Buy all the electronics

I understand there is no logic to this, I'm just describing the steps as I went through them... The main parts are:

- PCB: Gerber files in the "PCB Design" folder of this repository
- Electrical Components: Links to parts in the "Parts List" document" (Arduino Nano, HM-10 Bluetooth Chip, H-Bridge, 7.4v Lipo, Buck Converter, LED, Servos, Linear Servo, N20 Motors, Switch, Button, Resistors,Speaker/Amplifier)

## Step 3:
Start putting everything together.... Okay, you got me. I'm not here yet, so no more instructions for now.
